"""Stage-2 refinement: reduce a greedy low-threshold candidate list to real vectors.

Propose-then-refine (owner design): stage 1 over-detects at a LOW confidence
threshold (high recall); stage 2 here encodes the physical constraints to reject
false positives while keeping faint real peaks:
  - PERSISTENCE: real peaks recur in adjacent real-space scan positions.
  - OVERLAP MERGE: collapse double-detections of the same spot.
  - FRIEDEL (soft): peaks with a +g/-g partner about the centre score higher
    (a soft prior — amorphous/disordered legitimately breaks Friedel, so NOT a
    hard filter).
Each candidate gets a score combining model confidence + these signals; a final
threshold on the combined score keeps the real ones.
